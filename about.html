                In 2020, I read a post on LinkedIn from my friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rondsmith/" target="_blank">Ron Smith</a> of <a href="https://www.chalder.ca/" target="_blank">Chalder Consulting</a>. 
                He was inquirying about configuring IIS for setting up impersonation for an office mate. I replied to his message and headed to his office.
                That little trip would lead to a conversation with Ron about one of his clients and next thing I knew, I was sitting with my wife and lawyer, setting up my professional services company,
                 and <a href="http://riptidesoftware.io" target="_blank">Riptide Software</a> was born.
